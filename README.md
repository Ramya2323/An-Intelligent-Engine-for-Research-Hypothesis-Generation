# An-Intelligent-Engine-for-Research-Hypothesis-Generation
Developing new and impactful hypotheses is perhaps one of the most tedious and challenging tasks involved in conducting academic research. Often researchers find that they have vast amounts of literature to search through to confirm what their potential research questions ought to be: relevant yet innovative. To overcome this challenge, we created HypothAIze, an intelligent engine to automate the hypothesis generation process. We employ a Streamlit-based web application for fetching research abstracts from arXiv, processing them using a T5 transformer model, and generating novel research hypotheses. For relevance and quality control of the generated hypotheses, we enforce a similarity score mechanism evaluating the degree of approximation between each hypothesis and existing literature. It not only accelerates the ideation phase of research but is also equipped with an effective ability on the part of researchers to explore new ideas in specific areas of academics, thus boosting productivity and innovation.
